Why do we use disk images in digital forensics?
We use disk images because they have vast amounts of storage data, and that is 
extremely valuable with any type of case needed as it is data and data is info and info is what forensics needs.

Provide an example and describe a use case.
A use case is a software and system engineering term that describes how a user uses a system to accomplish a 
particular goal. An example of a use case would be *student inputs her name and student number. System verifies 
the student is eligible to enroll in seminars. If not eligible then the student is informed and use case ends. 
System displays list of available seminars. Student chooses a seminar or decides not to enroll at all. System 
validates the student is eligible to enroll in the chosen seminar. If not eligible, the student is asked to 
choose another. System validates the seminar fits into the student's schedule. System calculates and displays fees. 
Student verifies the cost and either indicates she wants to enroll or not. System enrolls the student in the 
seminar and bills them for it. The system prints enrollment receipt.*

What are the steps of creating a blank disk image and then adding files?
First you have to create and empty file by typing
fallocate -l 512M image.iso
Next you turn the file into a virtual disk by adding a file system. mkfs.ext4 -j image.iso
Finally, to make it universal you have to type
mkfs.fat image.iso

How does the OSI model relate to the use of disk images?
The OSI mainly highlights communication functions whereas disk images mainly deal with the actual software 
structure and the OS.
