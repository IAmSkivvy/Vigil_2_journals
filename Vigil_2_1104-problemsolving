    At Rackspace, the most important skills noted for achieving employment were problem-solving and active code 
  development.

    For example, presenters noted that they would be most likely to hire someone who goes home and spends hours 
  working with Linux and networking.

    Does that describe you? Why or why not?
No because I literally can't even recover a disk image so why would I try to learn an OS that I really dont like? 
Also with the temptation of Steam, Windows and the Internet, I'd rather not even get hired at Rackspace.

    Similarly, presenters noted a demand for employees who were good at independent problem solving. Does that 
  describe you? Why or why not?
Yes I do like solving my own problems as it gives a better satisfaction then having someone do it for you. 
Still don't wanna work at Rackspace still. Like at all.

    Have you finished your disk image? Why or why not? 
I hadn't when I should have done this journal but now I have.
